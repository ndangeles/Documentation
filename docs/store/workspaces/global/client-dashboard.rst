Client Dashboards
=================

Dashboards are a powerful feature used to quickly support decisions related to a specific client or project.

The goal is to give the ability to control processes in a very friendly and comprehensive way.

As a project manager is very useful to understand the status of a specific client and control the profitability of each project. This way the PM will have the tools to negotiate with their clients.

There are several Dashboards at the client level available in the system that will display different information.
