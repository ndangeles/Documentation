Profitability
=============

1. Go to the client module;
2. Select the client you want to check;
3. Press on Profitability Dashboard 

This Dashboard shows you in a glimpse the projects, under the client you have selected, 
which returns you a higher profit (based on the income value quoted to the client)

You will be able to analyze the planned profit per project, and per typology.
