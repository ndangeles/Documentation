Welcome to Skills Workflow's documentation
==========================================

`Skills Workflow`_ is a *groundbreaking platform* for agencies.
A platform to design your agency.
People make the difference.

Brand it, shape it, own it
   Take ownership of the look and feel of the tool. 
   Tailor it to your agency needs and show information the way you always wanted.
   If the tons of features, that ship with the platform, 
   don't take you were you want to go, you can use low level extensibility:
   
   * Use the SDK to extend behaviour with JavaScript
   * Call on the API to change data and apply rules
   * Resort to the Automation Engine to integrate with other tools

No Code
   Create your own dashboards and interactive screens simply by specifying what 
   you want to show and how you want it to look like. 
   Then, just turn on interactivity to change data or trigger processes:

   * Pre-defined behaviours for all main features
   * Adapt existing dashboards to create new ones
   * Create the interactive dashboards you have always needed

Top user experience
   Create interactive dashboards, perfect for the purpose you need, 
   for each profile at the agency, be it a manager, a head, an executor, 
   a client or even an external contractor or supplier:

   * Define the way you want the menu to look like
   * Become an artist, create a dashboard for each need
   * Add rich interactivity that elevates productivity
   * Use your own language. Don't accept software jargon
   * Access rights to features and security access to data

Beautiful Insights
   Have full visibility on what's going on inside the agency with powerful 
   beautiful visualizations of your data. Use pre-built interactive dashboards 
   or build your own.

   * Transform your project data into gorgeous visualizations
   * Convey the big picture into interactive dashboards
   * Customize the color, shape, size or pictures
   * Choose from a vast selection of different charts and diagrams
