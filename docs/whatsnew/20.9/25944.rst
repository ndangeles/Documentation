Clients from SAP will generate an internal client number when Company code is missing 
=====================================================================================

.. note::
        **Work Item** 25944

**Cause**

Clients were being created without internal number.
    1. It was found an issue when saving a billing client.
    2. Whenever the Company code was missing in the Company configuration, the client's internal number was not being generated.


**Prevent Future Issues**

Everytime a new client is received from SAP and the Company code is missing, it will generate a internal number for that client.

The information will be also logged, if the log level is set as "Info".

**Configurations**

In the Company's configuration, the Code should be configured.

**Proposed Tests**

    1. In Company's settings, configure the code
    2. Create a new client on SAP
    3. Check that the client is successfully created in the system
    4. Repeat the step 2 and 3, this time without the Company code filled in the Company's configuration

**Historical data**

It was generated the internal number for all the clients without it.
